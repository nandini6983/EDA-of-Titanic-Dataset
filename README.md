# EDA-of-Titanic-Dataset
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis of Titanic Dataset

Explored the Titanic dataset, performed data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA). We visualized relationships between passenger features (such as age, gender, class, and family size) and survival rates. I used google colab for Performing EDA

Key Insights:

Female passengers had a much higher chance of survival compared to males.
Passengers in higher classes (Pclass 1) were more likely to survive than those in lower classes.
Family presence (not being alone) slightly increased survival chances.
Fare and Age also showed meaningful patterns when analyzed against survival.
This analysis not only highlights the importance of demographic and socio-economic factors in survival but also provides a strong foundation for building predictive models.
